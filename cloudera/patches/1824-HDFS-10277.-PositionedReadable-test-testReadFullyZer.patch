+
+The `java.io` API states that if the amount of data to be read (i.e. `length`)
+then the call must block until the amount of data available is greater than
+zero —that is, until there is some data. The call is not required to return
+when the buffer is full, or indeed block until there is no data left in
+the stream.
+
+That is, rather than `l` being simply defined as `min(length, len(data)-length)`,
+it strictly is an integer in the range `1..min(length, len(data)-length)`.
+While the caller may expect for as much as the buffer as possible to be filled
+in, it is within the specification for an implementation to always return
+a smaller number, perhaps only ever 1 byte.
+
+What is critical is that unless the destination buffer size is 0, the call
+must block until at least one byte is returned. Thus, for any data source
+of length greater than zero, repeated invocations of this `read()` operation
+will eventually read all the data.
