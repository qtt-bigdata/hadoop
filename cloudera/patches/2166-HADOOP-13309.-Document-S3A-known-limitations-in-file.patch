+1. **Authorization**. Hadoop uses the `FileStatus` class to
+represent core metadata of files and directories, including the owner, group and
+permissions.  Object stores might not have a viable way to persist this
+metadata, so they might need to populate `FileStatus` with stub values.  Even if
+the object store persists this metadata, it still might not be feasible for the
+object store to enforce file authorization in the same way as a traditional file
+system.  If the object store cannot persist this metadata, then the recommended
+convention is:
+    * File owner is reported as the current user.
+    * File group also is reported as the current user.
+    * Directory permissions are reported as 777.
+    * File permissions are reported as 666.
+    * File system APIs that set ownership and permissions execute successfully
+      without error, but they are no-ops.

 for HDFS. In terms of this specification, their implementations of the
 specified operations do not match those required. They are considered supported

-### Warning #3: your AWS credentials are valuable
+### Warning #3: Object stores have differerent authorization models
+
+The object authorization model of S3 is much different from the file
+authorization model of HDFS and traditional file systems.  It is not feasible to
+persist file ownership and permissions in S3, so S3A reports stub information
+from APIs that would query this metadata:
+
+* File owner is reported as the current user.
+* File group also is reported as the current user.  Prior to Apache Hadoop
+2.8.0, file group was reported as empty (no group associated), which is a
+potential incompatibility problem for scripts that perform positional parsing of
+shell output and other clients that expect to find a well-defined group.
+* Directory permissions are reported as 777.
+* File permissions are reported as 666.
+
+S3A does not really enforce any authorization checks on these stub permissions.
+Users authenticate to an S3 bucket using AWS credentials.  It's possible that
+object ACLs have been defined to enforce authorization at the S3 side, but this
+happens entirely within the S3 service, not within the S3A implementation.
