-Hadoop HDFS over HTTP - Server Setup
-====================================
-
-This page explains how to quickly setup HttpFS with Pseudo authentication against a Hadoop cluster with Pseudo authentication.
-
-Install HttpFS
---------------
-
-    ~ $ tar xzf  httpfs-${project.version}.tar.gz
-
-Configure HttpFS
-----------------
-
-By default, HttpFS assumes that Hadoop configuration files (`core-site.xml & hdfs-site.xml`) are in the HttpFS configuration directory.
-
-If this is not the case, add to the `httpfs-site.xml` file the `httpfs.hadoop.config.dir` property set to the location of the Hadoop configuration directory.
-
-Configure Hadoop
-----------------
-
-Edit Hadoop `core-site.xml` and defined the Unix user that will run the HttpFS server as a proxyuser. For example:
-
-```xml
-  <property>
-    <name>hadoop.proxyuser.#HTTPFSUSER#.hosts</name>
-    <value>httpfs-host.foo.com</value>
-  </property>
-  <property>
-    <name>hadoop.proxyuser.#HTTPFSUSER#.groups</name>
-    <value>*</value>
-  </property>
-```
-
-IMPORTANT: Replace `#HTTPFSUSER#` with the Unix user that will start the HttpFS server.
-
-Restart Hadoop
---------------
-
-You need to restart Hadoop for the proxyuser configuration to become active.
-
-Start/Stop HttpFS
------------------
-
-To start/stop HttpFS use HttpFS's sbin/httpfs.sh script. For example:
-
-    $ sbin/httpfs.sh start
-
-NOTE: Invoking the script without any parameters list all possible parameters (start, stop, run, etc.). The `httpfs.sh` script is a wrapper for Tomcat's `catalina.sh` script that sets the environment variables and Java System properties required to run HttpFS server.
-
-Test HttpFS is working
-----------------------
-
-    $ curl -sS 'http://<HTTPFSHOSTNAME>:14000/webhdfs/v1?op=gethomedirectory&user.name=hdfs'
-    {"Path":"\/user\/hdfs"}
-
-Embedded Tomcat Configuration
------------------------------
-
-To configure the embedded Tomcat go to the `tomcat/conf`.
-
-HttpFS preconfigures the HTTP and Admin ports in Tomcat's `server.xml` to 14000 and 14001.
-
-Tomcat logs are also preconfigured to go to HttpFS's `logs/` directory.
-
-HttpFS default value for the maxHttpHeaderSize parameter in Tomcat's `server.xml` is set to 65536 by default.
-
-The following environment variables (which can be set in HttpFS's `etc/hadoop/httpfs-env.sh` script) can be used to alter those values:
-
-* HTTPFS\_HTTP\_PORT
-
-* HTTPFS\_ADMIN\_PORT
-
-* HADOOP\_LOG\_DIR
-
-* HTTPFS\_MAX\_HTTP\_HEADER\_SIZE
-
-HttpFS Configuration
---------------------
-
-HttpFS supports the following [configuration properties](./httpfs-default.html) in the HttpFS's `etc/hadoop/httpfs-site.xml` configuration file.
-
-HttpFS over HTTPS (SSL)
------------------------
-
-To configure HttpFS to work over SSL edit the [httpfs-env.sh](#httpfs-env.sh) script in the configuration directory setting the [HTTPFS\_SSL\_ENABLED](#HTTPFS_SSL_ENABLED) to [true](#true).
-
-In addition, the following 2 properties may be defined (shown with default values):
-
-* HTTPFS\_SSL\_KEYSTORE\_FILE=$HOME/.keystore
-
-* HTTPFS\_SSL\_KEYSTORE\_PASS=password
-
-In the HttpFS `tomcat/conf` directory, replace the `server.xml` file with the `ssl-server.xml` file.
-
-You need to create an SSL certificate for the HttpFS server. As the `httpfs` Unix user, using the Java `keytool` command to create the SSL certificate:
-
-    $ keytool -genkey -alias tomcat -keyalg RSA
-
-You will be asked a series of questions in an interactive prompt. It will create the keystore file, which will be named **.keystore** and located in the `httpfs` user home directory.
-
-The password you enter for "keystore password" must match the value of the `HTTPFS_SSL_KEYSTORE_PASS` environment variable set in the `httpfs-env.sh` script in the configuration directory.
-
-The answer to "What is your first and last name?" (i.e. "CN") must be the hostname of the machine where the HttpFS Server will be running.
-
-Start HttpFS. It should work over HTTPS.
-
-Using the Hadoop `FileSystem` API or the Hadoop FS shell, use the `swebhdfs://` scheme. Make sure the JVM is picking up the truststore containing the public key of the SSL certificate if using a self-signed certificate.
-
-Set environment variable `HTTPFS_SSL_CLIENT_AUTH` to change client
-authentication. The default is `false`. See `clientAuth` in
-[Tomcat 6.0 SSL Support](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/config/http.html#SSL_Support).
-
-Set environment variable `HTTPFS_SSL_ENABLED_PROTOCOLS` to specify a list of
-enabled SSL protocols. The default list includes `TLSv1`, `TLSv1.1`,
-`TLSv1.2`, and `SSLv2Hello`. See `sslEnabledProtocols` in
-[Tomcat 6.0 SSL Support](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/config/http.html#SSL_Support).
-
-In order to support some old SSL clients, the default encryption ciphers
-include a few relatively weaker ciphers. Set environment variable
-`HTTPFS_SSL_CIPHERS` to override. The value is a comma separated list of
-ciphers in [Tomcat Wiki](https://wiki.apache.org/tomcat/Security/Ciphers).
