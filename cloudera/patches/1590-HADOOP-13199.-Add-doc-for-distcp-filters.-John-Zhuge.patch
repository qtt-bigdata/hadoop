 `-overwrite` | Overwrite destination | If a map fails and `-i` is not specified, all the files in the split, not only those that failed, will be recopied. As discussed in the Usage documentation, it also changes the semantics for generating destination paths, so users should use this carefully.
 `-update` | Overwrite if source and destination differ in size, blocksize, or checksum | As noted in the preceding, this is not a "sync" operation. The criteria examined are the source and destination file sizes, blocksizes, and checksums; if they differ, the source file replaces the destination file. As discussed in the Usage documentation, it also changes the semantics for generating destination paths, so users should use this carefully.
 `-f <urilist_uri>` | Use list at \<urilist_uri\> as src list | This is equivalent to listing each source on the command line. The `urilist_uri` list should be a fully qualified URI.
+`-filters` | The path to a file containing a list of pattern strings, one string per line, such that paths matching the pattern will be excluded from the copy. | Support regular expressions specified by java.util.regex.Pattern.
 `-filelimit <n>` | Limit the total number of files to be <= n | **Deprecated!** Ignored in the new DistCp.
 `-sizelimit <n>` | Limit the total size to be <= n bytes | **Deprecated!** Ignored in the new DistCp.
 `-delete` | Delete the files existing in the dst but not in src | The deletion is done by FS Shell. So the trash will be used, if it is enable.
