Subject: [PATCH 1845/2848] CLOUDERA-BUILD. Excluding flaky test
 TestCapacityScheduler.testRecoverRequestAfterPreemption.

Fixing it requires pulling in YARN-4502, which brings in other potentially de-stabilizing scheduler changes. This is a lot of work, particularly given we deprecated CapacityScheduler.
Excluding the entire test would render the CapacityScheduler test less.
