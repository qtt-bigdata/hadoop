+the Contributor Version) or other devices; or (3) under Patent Claims infringed
+by Covered Software in the absence of Modifications made by that
+Contributor. 
+
+3. Distribution Obligations. 
+
+3.1. Availability of Source
+Code. Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in
+Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and that Source
+Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this License. You must
+include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code form of the
+Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make available. You must inform
+recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can
+obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or
+through a medium customarily used for software exchange. 
+
+3.2.
+Modifications. The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are
+governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe Your
+Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to
+grant the rights conveyed by this License. 
+
+3.3. Required Notices. You must
+include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You as the
+Contributor of the Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright,
+patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any
+notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any
+Contributor or the Initial Developer. 
+
+3.4. Application of Additional Terms.
+You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code
+form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the
+recipients rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,
+warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients
+of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
+behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely
+clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
+offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer
+and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or
+such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms
+You offer.
+
+3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute the
+Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this License or under
+the terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from
+this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License
+and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter
+the recipients rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this
+License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a
+different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
+from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or
+Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
+Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such
+Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. 
+
+3.6. Larger Works. You
+may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not
+governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single
+product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are
+fulfilled for the Covered Software. 
+
+4. Versions of the License. 
+
+4.1.
+New Versions. Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may
+publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each
+version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in
+Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify this
+License. 
+
+4.2. Effect of New Versions. You may always continue to use,
+distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of
+the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered
+Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software
+prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available under any
+subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered
+Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You
+originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use,
+distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of
+any subsequent version of the License published by the license
+steward. 
+
+4.3. Modified Versions. When You are an Initial Developer and You
+want to create a new license for Your Original Software, You may create and use
+a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove
+any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the
+license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the
+license contains terms which differ from this License. 
+
+5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
+
+COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS,
+WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
+LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
+MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS
+TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY
+COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER
+OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
+CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS
+LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER
+THIS DISCLAIMER. 
+
+6. TERMINATION. 
+
+6.1. This License and the rights
+granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms
+herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the
+breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the
+termination of this License shall survive. 
+
+6.2. If You assert a patent
+infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial
+Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom
+You assert such claim is referred to as Participant) alleging that the
+Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a
+Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial
+Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights
+granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer
+(if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under
+Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from
+Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such
+60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your
+claim with respect to the Participant Software against such Participant either
+unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant. 
+
+6.3. In
+the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses
+that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to
+termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor) shall survive
+termination. 
+
+7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
+UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER
+NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE,
+SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
+COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY
+PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
+CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF
+GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
+COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE
+POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO
+LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO
+THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT
+ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
+THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 
+
+8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
+
+The Covered Software is a commercial item, as that term is defined in
+48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial computer software (as
+that term is defined at 48 C.F.R.  252.227-7014(a)(1)) and commercial computer
+software documentation as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.
+1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through
+227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software
+with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is
+in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision
+that addresses Government rights in computer software under this
+License. 
+
+9. MISCELLANEOUS.
+This License represents the complete agreement
+concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
+unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to
+make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the
+jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the Original Software
+(except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding
+such jurisdictions conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this
+License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the
+jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original
+Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without
+limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The
+application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
+Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that
+the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not
+apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance
+with the United States export administration regulations (and the export control
+laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or
+otherwise make available any Covered Software. 
+
+10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
+As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
+responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its
+utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial
+Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable
+basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission
+of liability.

+
+3. Distribution Obligations.
+
+3.1. Availability of Source Code.
+Any Covered Software that You distribute or
+otherwise make available in Executable form must also be made available in
+Source Code form and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the
+terms of this License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy
+of the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make
+available. You must inform recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable
+form as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a
+reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software
+exchange.
+3.2. Modifications.
+The Modifications that You create or to which
+You contribute are governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You
+believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have
+sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.
+3.3. Required Notices.
+You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that
+identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not remove or
+alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered
+Software, or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution
+to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.
+3.4. Application of Additional Terms.
+You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source
+Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the
+recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,
+warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients
+of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
+behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely
+clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
+offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer
+and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or
+such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms
+You offer.
+3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.
+You may distribute the
+Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this License or under
+the terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from
+this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License
+and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter
+the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in
+this License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a
+different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
+from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or
+Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
+Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such
+Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.
+3.6. Larger Works.
+You
+may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not
+governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single
+product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are
+fulfilled for the Covered Software.
+
+4. Versions of the License.
+
+4.1. New Versions.
+Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or
+new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a
+distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other
+than the license steward has the right to modify this License.
+4.2. Effect of New Versions.
+You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the
+Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under
+which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer
+includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed
+or otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, You
+must distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms of the
+version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software.
+Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered
+Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of the License
+published by the license steward.
+4.3. Modified Versions.
+When You are an
+Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your Original
+Software, You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: (a)
+rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward
+(except to note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise
+make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this
+License.
+
+5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
+
+COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS
+LICENSE ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
+OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE
+IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
+NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED
+SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY
+RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE
+COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF
+WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED
+SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
+
+6. TERMINATION.
+
+6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will
+terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
+such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by
+their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall
+survive.
+6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory
+judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial
+Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as
+“Participant”) alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the
+Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original
+Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly
+infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to
+You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not
+the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this
+License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and
+automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within
+such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant
+Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written
+agreement with Participant.
+6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim
+against Participant alleging that the Participant Software directly or
+indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license
+or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then
+the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections
+2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any
+payment or license.
+6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2
+above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any
+distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by
+any distributor) shall survive termination.
+
+7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
+
+UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
+(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL
+DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY
+SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT,
+SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING,
+WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER
+FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN
+IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS
+LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL
+INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
+PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
+LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND
+LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
+
+8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
+
+The Covered
+Software is a “commercial item,” as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101
+(Oct. 1995), consisting of “commercial computer software” (as that term is
+defined at 48 C.F.R. § 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and “commercial computer software
+documentation” as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995).
+Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4
+(June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only
+those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of,
+and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses
+Government rights in computer software under this License.
+
+9. MISCELLANEOUS.
+
+This License represents the complete agreement concerning
+subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
+unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to
+make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the
+jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the Original Software
+(except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding
+such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this
+License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the
+jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original
+Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without
+limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The
+application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
+Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that
+the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not
+apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance
+with the United States export administration regulations (and the export control
+laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or
+otherwise make available any Covered Software.
+
+10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
+
+As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
+responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its
+utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial
+Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable
+basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission
+of liability.

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+Eclipse Public License - v 1.0
+
+THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC
+LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM
+CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
+
+1. DEFINITIONS
+
+"Contribution" means:
+
+a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation
+distributed under this Agreement, and
+b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
+i) changes to the Program, and
+ii) additions to the Program;
+where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are
+distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a
+Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone
+acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to
+the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
+conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not
+derivative works of the Program.
+"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
+
+"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
+necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
+combined with the Program.
+
+"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.
+
+"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
+including all Contributors.
+
+2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
+
+a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
+Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
+reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
+distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such
+derivative works, in source code and object code form.
+b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
+Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed
+Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the
+Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form.
+This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the
+Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
+addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
+Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations
+which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
+c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to
+its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any
+Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual
+property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to
+Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of
+intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
+rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole
+responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.
+For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to
+distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
+before distributing the Program.
+d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright
+rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in
+this Agreement.
+3. REQUIREMENTS
+
+A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its
+own license agreement, provided that:
+
+a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
+b) its license agreement:
+i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and
+conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and
+non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and
+fitness for a particular purpose;
+ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
+damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential
+damages, such as lost profits;
+iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by
+that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
+iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor,
+and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a
+medium customarily used for software exchange.
+When the Program is made available in source code form:
+
+a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
+b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
+Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the
+Program.
+
+Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if
+any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the
+originator of the Contribution.
+
+4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
+
+Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
+respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
+intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
+includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
+which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if
+a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
+Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
+every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages
+and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
+actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
+extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in
+connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product
+offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
+relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order
+to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
+Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to
+control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
+related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in
+any such claim at its own expense.
+
+For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
+offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that
+Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties
+related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such
+Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
+Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
+Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court
+requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
+Contributor must pay those damages.
+
+5. NO WARRANTY
+
+EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN
+"AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
+IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,
+NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each
+Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
+distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of
+rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs
+of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,
+programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
+
+6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
+
+EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
+CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
+SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
+PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
+STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY
+OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
+GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
+
+7. GENERAL
+
+If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
+law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
+terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such
+provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
+provision valid and enforceable.
+
+If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a
+cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself
+(excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)
+infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under
+Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
+
+All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
+comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does
+not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of
+such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,
+Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
+reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement
+and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and
+survive.
+
+Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in
+order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be
+modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to
+publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.
+No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.
+The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation
+may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable
+separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a
+distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always
+be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
+received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
+Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions)
+under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b)
+above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of
+any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
+estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under
+this Agreement are reserved.
+
+This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
+intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this
+Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year
+after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in
+any resulting litigation.
