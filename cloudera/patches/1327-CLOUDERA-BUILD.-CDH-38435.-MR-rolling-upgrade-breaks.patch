Subject: [PATCH 1327/2848] CLOUDERA-BUILD. CDH-38435. MR rolling upgrade
 breaks due to security fix introduced in
 CDH-27001.

More details:
- CDH-27001 fixes a security issue that concerns storing the key used to encrypt
  spill data alongside the spill itself. The fix here was to send this key from
  AM to Task over Hadoop RPC. Since it is not versioned, this leads to an
  incompatibility and breaks rolling upgrade.
- In CDH-38435, we fix this by reusing extraData, which was originally
  introduced to run MR1 on Mesos, for storing this key instead of serializing it
  separately. Both extraData and setExtraData are non-public methods in a
  @Private @Unstable class, and we are not obligated to support it.

Testing:
- To test this fix, we ran a cluster with two nodes using 5.5.0 bits and 1 node
  using these bits. We were successfully able to run jobs with AM running 5.5.0
  and AM running 5.7.0. And, a job with the intermediate data encrypted.
